Planetarium Application

A web-based application designed to help users explore, document, and manage celestial objects such as planets and moons. This application leverages a fully functional back-end for creating, retrieving, and deleting planetary data while providing a user-friendly front-end interface. This was cycle 1 of the planetarium application before moving into a Scrum team.
